- 👋 Hi there, I’m @tamaianh
- 👀 I'm a 30-something student who's just starting to learn how to code. I'm excited to document my journey as I delve deeper into the world of programming and share my experiences with others who may be on a similar path.
- 👀 I'm a lover of books, music, and travel. I also have a passion for minimalism and simplifying my life in every way possible. I find that these interests help keep me balanced and focused, even as I navigate the challenges of learning to code.
- 🌱 Right now, I'm focusing on the basics of programming, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also learning how to use GitHub to manage my code and collaborate with others. As I progress, I hope to explore more advanced topics, such as data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
- 💞️ I'm currently working on a few small projects to help me solidify my understanding of the concepts I'm learning. One project involves creating a simple website for a local business, while another involves building a basic calculator using JavaScript. I'm also exploring the world of APIs and hope to create a project that utilizes one in the near future.
- 📫 I welcome any feedback or suggestions from other learners or experienced programmers alike. If you have any resources, tips, or advice to share, please reach out! I'm also open to collaboration on projects or just connecting with others who are passionate about learning to code.
- 👋 If you'd like to reach me, pls leave me a message. Thank you.
